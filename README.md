# Puzzle Bubble clone

This was a game I made for Mega Cat Studios as part of the technical assessment. Using WASD, space, or the mouse, the player must empty all of the bubbles by matching the colors of the target to the indicator below.
All assets, designs, and concepts used in this project are credited to Mega Cat Studios.
